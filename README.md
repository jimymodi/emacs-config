# Emacs Configuration

My new and improved emacs configuration as a result of 
attending the talk "Emacs as Python IDE" by Noufal Ibrahim
at PyconIndia 2011

Some parts have been directly lifted from Noufal's config 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/nibrahim/Config-files)

This is a light weight setup I will be using at home .
Basically,
    ```
    (office emacs config) - (jde-mode + flymake + yasnippet)
    ```
